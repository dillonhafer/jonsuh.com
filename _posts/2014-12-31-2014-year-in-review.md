From our new daughter, one year at my new job, and my spiritual growth to learning and giving back as a developer, 2014 has been a full, enlightening year.

<!--more-->

I’ve broken this post into 2 sections:

1. [Developer](#sass-and-javascript)
2. [Life](#years-of-marriage "Skip to Life")

## Sass and JavaScript

I worked hard this year to really level-up my Sass and JavaScript, and although I know I can still use a lot of work on both (especially JavaScript), I learned a tremendous amount this past year.

I tailored my own flavor and style of <a href="https://github.com/jonsuh/jonsuh.com/blob/github/assets/sass/screen.scss" target="_blank">organizing Sass</a>, which is derived from a mix of SMACSS, OOCSS and BEM. This has exponentially sped up my front-end development and has made projects easier to maintain and iterate on with time and amongst multiple developers. I really want to, and probably should, write an in-depth post on how I approach organizing Sass and writing CSS.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>This is how I’ve organized my Sass in 2 recent projects. How does your Sass structure look like? <a href="http://t.co/7yu0LiyQXT">pic.twitter.com/7yu0LiyQXT</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Suh (@jonsuh) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonsuh/status/507607445276221440">September 4, 2014</a></blockquote>

I also dedicated a few weeks of studying <a href="https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns" target="_blank">JavaScript design patterns</a> and refactoring old JavaScript I had written as well as rewriting jQuery to vanilla JavaScript.

The early stages were definitely <a href="https://twitter.com/jonsuh/status/434447173250330624" target="_blank">humble beginnings</a>, but I can confidently say that I’ve <a href="https://github.com/jonsuh/jonsuh.com/blob/github/assets/js/src/utility.js" target="_blank">come a long way</a>.

## Grunt

Of the new tools that I’ve discovered and learned this past year, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> has become an invaluable part of my development architecture and workflow.

I spent January experimenting and exploring Grunt, and after only a month, I found myself integrating it into every project. From <a href="https://twitter.com/jonsuh/status/522867758518636544" target="_blank">shaving a few seconds off every Sass compile</a> to running deployments, it has saved me countless hours of keystrokes and clicks by automating a lot of the development tasks I run on a daily basis. I wrote a couple of posts that may help those who are curious about, new to, or already using Grunt: <a href="/blog/get-started-with-grunt/" target="_blank">Get Started with Grunt</a> and <a href="/blog/take-grunt-to-the-next-level/" target="_blank">Take Grunt to the Next Level</a>

## SVG

I love SVG. A project came up at <a href="http://www.juiceinteractive.com" target="_blank">Juice</a> that I’d be handling development for, and the design team bounced ideas for animating illustrations. Initially we had thought GIFs would suffice, but we weren’t pleased with the quality of GIFs. Considering SVGs are infinitely scalable, are well supported by browsers, and work well with CSS, I set on a path to learn.

<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I managed to take all of the animations originally created in After Effects and recreate them with SVG and CSS. It was tough at first and tricky, but I had a ton of fun and learned a lot. It even led me to take what I’ve learned and write a post on how to <a href="/blog/animate-svg-with-css/">Animate SVG with CSS</a>.

## Giving back

I made a conscious effort to give back to the web and open-source community—after all, I’m a self-taught developer and designer, and with all those who’ve given me the opportunity to learn with their contributions, I felt it was only right and my turn to give back. I spread out my efforts through various channels.

Here are some of the things I did this year:

- Wrote 13 how-to guides/tutorials on my <a href="/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>
- Answered 47 questions and earned 1,247 reputation on <a href="{{ site.social.stackoverflow }}">StackOverflow</a>
- Open-sourced my website on <a href="https://github.com/jonsuh/jonsuh.com" target="_blank">Github</a>
- Volunteered to teach a HTML & CSS animations workshop for AIGA Chicago students in the mentor program

## 4 Years of Marriage

Becky and I have been married 4 years, and it’s been quite a journey. We’ve shared many laughs and tears, and through thick or thin, there isn’t another person I’d want to live life and share those moments with. She’s been patient in spite of my impatience and understanding through my density, and has managed to look past my incorrigibility—her love and support make me feel like I can conquer the world. She’s also an incredible, loving mother to our children—she puts in an atonishing amount of work to care for and nurture our children.

## Father of 2

My wife and I welcomed our sweet, little girl, Katelyn, into our family in September. I was reminded how brave and strong how my wife is, how much work and challenging it is to raise a newborn, and how much joy and happiness a baby brings to a home.

However, watching Katelyn and Silas, my 3-year-old boy, interact has been by far the most rewarding. He’s always looking out for her and is beyond sweet and caring—he has yet to show an ounce of jealousy, which frankly I was worried about before Katelyn’s arrival. Our kids have transformed our world (for the better) and have brought so much joy to our home—we can’t imagine our lives without them.

## 1 Year at Juice Interactive

August marked one year at <a href="http://www.juiceinteractive.com" target="_blank">Juice Interactive</a>. I’m thankful for a job and employers that allow me the flexibility to occasionally work from home so I can spend more time with my family; support my life at home and look out for my work-life balance; offer opportunities to work on fun, <a href="http://www.juiceinteractive.com/work/" target="_blank">challenging projects</a> with some <a href="http://www.juiceinteractive.com/about/" target="_blank">smart, talented folks</a>; make work a place I can couple “work” and “hobby” together; and throw <a href="https://twitter.com/latokarz/status/494829469161357314" target="_blank">birthday parties</a> for its employees. The environment that Juice provides not only allows me to grow as a developer but also as a husband and father.

## Spiritual Growth

I’ve had many questions about my faith: things I’ve been taught, the Scriptures itself, and general ponderings. The motive of my questioning wasn’t to doubt nor was it a quest to find an alternate answer that was suitable for what I believed had to be right, but instead questioning and seeking to get a deeper, better understanding of my faith.

I still have a lot of questions and can’t say I have any straightforward answers, but I’ve learned that life, God, the Scriptures and its answers aren’t so one-dimensional, black or white, right or wrong, like I have the tendency to make things. In my attempt to define and formulate God and His attributes within the bounds of my finite mind, I must be careful that I’m not inadvertently invalidating and nullifying God’s infinite nature—Christianity and faith isn’t a science. I must be careful that I’m not using my shallow interpretation of the Scriptures as a public or internal whipping post to shame others, but instead find ways to love, harmonize, and forgive amongst our differences.
